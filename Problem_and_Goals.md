    Our app 'Disaster Emergency Alerts and Preparedness'(DEAP) attempts to provide users with a simple and intuitive UI that can help alleviate stress that can hinder safety during a natural disaster. DEAP provides Disaster updates to users depending on their location, as well as useful news regarding the enviroment of the user. There is also a map that provides the user with the safest route possible to escape as well as other useful information that can help the user prepare for a natural disaster.
