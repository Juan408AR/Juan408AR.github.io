title: Problem and Goals
---

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
As a team, we had brainstormed various problems and came up with potential designs to solve these problem. Since most of us lived in California and had some experience with wildfires, we became interested about helping people during a natural disaster.

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
We thought that we can make a difference if our application could provide credible information, encourge preemptive planning, and guide people to safety during a natural disaster. Our app would alert people of natural disasters in their area and provide information on how to safely evacuate. The app would also encourage people to make a plan so that they're prepared in case a natural disaster happens near them.

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
Our app would be available to anyone, but our targeted users would be the most vulnerable in natural disasters, which are the elderly, people with disabilities, people of color, and people living in poverty. We have seen that during the California Camp Fire, many of the people that perished were elderly, infirm, or disabled. We also know that Hurricane Katrina disproportionately impacted Black residents in New Orelans. Black, Hispanic, or Native American communities were 50% more at risk of wildfires compared to White communities in the United States. Natural disasters like wildfires intensify poverty. People living in poverty suffer the most economic damage from these disasters. People living in poverty are more likely to live in risky areas and less likely to live in areas that have high-quality fire-protection services.
