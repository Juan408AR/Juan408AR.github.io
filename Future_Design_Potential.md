title: Future Design Potential

When thinking about our future design potential, we will use what we've learned from our research and our models we've iterated and learned from.
</p>

Some of the things that we've learned is that many first responders face issues that inhibit their ability to help people. Some of these issues are when firefighters don't knopw the inside of the house they are about to enter. When the house is on fire and filled with smoke, it can hinder their ability to do their job. One more issue that comes to mind is when you are calling 911, you may be putt on hold. To circumvent one of these issues, our application has to allow users to upload their blueprints of their house so firefighters can view them.

The first responders we interviewed gave us invaluable data, but we've also learned from people that actually had experienced a natural disaster and had to evacuate. Their input will also have a huge influence on our design process. Those that had to evacuate needed access to fast and reliable information, which is what our application would need to maintain in all future designs. Our application will need to be trustworthy and reliable in order for information sent to be accepted and used. Also, our application needs to be able to even communicate to people that might be in a state of people. This could be ahcieved by focusing on actions over words. These actions might be reminding them to keep breathing, focus on getting to safety, etc. In addition to what is mentioned earlier, we will need to adopt a minimialist design, which will cut clutter, make it easy to read, make updates small, and only having emergency updates.
